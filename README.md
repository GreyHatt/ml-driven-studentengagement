# ml-driven-studentengagement

## Components:

**Frontend (Student Interaction):** This is where students interact, providing data such as attendance, performance, feedback, etc.

**Backend API (Python):** This is the server-side logic that processes the student data and interacts with other services (e.g., BigQuery).

**Docker:** Containerizes the backend API for easy deployment.

**Kubernetes:** Orchestrates the containers for scalability.

**BigQuery:** Stores and processes student metrics and feedback data.

**CI/CD Pipeline (GitHub):** Ensures that code is tested and deployed automatically.
